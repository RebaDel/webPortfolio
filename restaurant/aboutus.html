<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>Not so long ago, in a land not so far away, a young mother was challenged to feed her growing family. This was not the normal challenge most mothers face, 
for her children reacted to the most common of ingredients. Several were allergic to eggs, some to wheat, and some to dairy. What was the poor woman to do?</p>
<p>But this was a brave woman full of ingenuity. She found other ingredients that did not bother her little ones' tummies. And so, she raised her large family on 
healthy food, spending hours in the kitchen every day. This is the story of our mother.</p>
<p>We were blessed to be born to a woman dedicated to finding ways to make unusual ingredients taste wonderful. Today we share those recipes and more developed 
over the years in our family restaurant and deli. Our mission is to help others find enjoyment in healthy food in spite of sensitive systems and tight schedules.</p>
