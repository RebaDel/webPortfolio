This is the code for my website. While I have hand typed all of it, some of the projects represented are guided tutorials.
In particular, the ToDo tracker that uses local memory, the match game and address book using JavaScript and React, and the quote page using an API were all created using outside guidance.
I have applied some of these tools to the index page and expect to have more projects added in the future.
